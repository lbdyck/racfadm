  200417-A   RACFUSR     Closed   sbgolob    V16R3

  DESCRIPTION:
    Doing a SE (search) on a userid list from Option 1, gives a list
    of classes pertaining to the userid.  If you type "S" next to one
    of the classes (say the FACILITY class), then you get the following
    set of error messages:
    WRONG PARAMETER, SHOULD BE SPECIAL/NOSPECIAL/OPERATIONS/NOOPERATIONS

    160 +++     x = RACFAUTH(class profile user)
    69 +++  rc = display_table_permit()
    IRX0040I Error running RACFCLSS, line 160: Incorrect call to routine

    337 +++       call RACFCLSS user
    199 +++  call Profl
    IRX0040I Error running RACFUSR, line 337: Incorrect call to routine
    ***

    This pertains to V16R0.

  RESOLUTION:
    Site had an executable program called RACFAUTH in their linklist,
    causing a conflict with RACFADM's REXX program with the same name

    So, renamed RACFADM's rexx program RACFAUTH to RACFCLSA

  DESCRIPTION:
    Trying to change a userid's attributes for SPECIAL, OPERATIONS, etc.

    Type C for change, get the LU and the screen to type over.  I type
    over the attributes and the generated ALU does not list what I
    typed.

    It is no wonder, that the attributes have not been changed.
    (Just another problem reported.  This one shouldn't be hard to fix.
    Just change the generated ALU command.)

  RESOLUTION:
    Updated panel (RACFUSR5) and REXX program (RACFUSR) to display/get
    Attributes: Special, Operations and Auditor (Y=Yes, N=No)

  DESCRIPTION:
    Tried removing the attribute of SPECIAL for a userid, and there
    seems to be the following problem:  When you ADD attributes, the
    RACFADM dialog can read them from the line which says ATTRIBUTES,
    and it enters them into the generated ALU or ALTUSER command to
    change the attribute.  The syntax of the ALU command requires
    (for removal of attributes):  that you have to say NOSPECIAL,
    NOOPERATIONS, or NOAUDITOR specifically.  So if you want to
    remove attribute of SPECIAL, you have to specifically write on the
    ATTRIBUTE line:  NOSPECIAL, so the NOSPECIAL word gets generated
    into the ALU command.

    Once this was done:  coding NOSPECIAL in the ATTRIBUTES line, then
    the attribute of SPECIAL is indeed removed.  However the dialog
    does not do an LU to "feel" that there are no attributes left,
    and it doesn't remove the YES from the attribute column for that
    userid:

  RESOLUTION:
    Added subroutine UPDATTR, will issue 'LU userid TSO' command
    and populate the ATTR and ATTR2 variables with current information

  DESCRIPTION:
    Create worked fine.  Delete also seemed to work fine.  Just left
    over datasets like the ISPF profile and userid.BRODCAST

  RESOLUTION:
    Added quotes to user in DELETE/DEFINE ALIAS commands in RACFUSRT.

  DESCRIPTION:
    If you add a new and different userid under a circumstance when it
    is an error to do so, it still gets added to the ISPF table of
    userids, and it doesn't come off unless you redisplay the table.

  RESOLUTION:
    Fixed checking return code after executing RACF command

  DESCRIPTION:
    With dataset profiles that got added, and they didn't show up in
    the table until you redisplayed it.  Most of the times though, the
    new items DO show up, and most of the times deleted items don't
    show up.

  DESCRIPTION:
    I tried to do a change on a userid with a TSO segment, to delete
    the TSO Segment.  The dialog said that there was no more TSO
    segment in the list, but it was still there, and you could LOGON
    to it.  In other words, NO ACTUAL DELETION.  I don't think there
    is a command issued to delete the TSO segment.

  RESOLUTION:
    Dialog should not delete the TSO segment based on the TSO = 'NO'
    panel field value.  To delete a TSO Segment, issue the
    "ALTUSER user NOTSO" command.

  DESCRIPTION:
    With RACF command tracing on, and you do the "C"  on the id, and
    change TSO from NO to YES, you get some strange pathing through
    RACF commands, it seems to be looping through them, then you get
    multiple windows, and then when you finally get out of the mess,
    with enough PF3's, the job actually seems to have been done.

  RESOLUTION:
    NOP'd the CHGD, ERROR, and DISPLAY_MSG sections in RACFUSRT.

  200304-A   RACFUSR     Closed   sbgolob    V8R3

  DESCRIPTION:
    Added attributes of SPECIAL and OPERATIONS to a userid which
    didn't have any.  The YES did not show up on the userid menu when
    it re-displayed, after the change.  In order to see the changes
    reflected in the table, I had to completely redisplay the
    userids.

  RESOLUTION:
    Add code to check to see if attributes where added/removed, if so
    update the ATT column to contain YES or NO.

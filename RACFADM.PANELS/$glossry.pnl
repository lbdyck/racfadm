)F FUNCTION -
 This glossary includes technical terms and abbreviations for RACF.

=A
    access.  The ability to use a protected resource.

    access authority.  (1) The privileges granted to a particular user
    or group when accessing a protected resource (such as the ability to
    read or to update a data set). For resources protected by RACF
    profiles, the access authorities are NONE, EXECUTE, READ, UPDATE,
    CONTROL, and ALTER.  These authorities are hierarchical, with READ
    also granting EXECUTE, UPDATE granting READ, and so forth.  (2) RACF
    also has access authorities of READ, WRITE, and EXECUTE (or SEARCH)
    when dealing with z/OS UNIX files and directories. Note that these
    authorities are not hierarchical, and that z/OS UNIX files are not
    protected by RACF profiles, although they do have access
    authorities.

    access ACL.  An ACL that is used to provide protection for a file
    system object.

    access control.  In computer security, ensuring that the resources
    of a computer system can be accessed only by authorized users in
    authorized ways.

    access control list (ACL).  (1) In computer security, a collection
    of all access rights for one object. In computer security, a list
    associated with an object that identifies all the subjects that can
    access the object and their access rights; for example, a list
    associated with a file that identifies users who can access the file
    and identifies their access rights to that file. (2) In z/OS UNIX,
    an extension to the base POSIX permission bits. Similar to the
    access list of a RACF profile, an ACL for a file system object
    contains entries that specify access permissions for individual
    users and groups.

    ACL.  See access control list.

    access list.  Synonym for standard access list. Contrast with
    conditional access list.

    ACEE.  (accessor environment element) A control block that contains
    a description of the current user's security environment, including
    user ID, current connect group, user attributes, and group
    authorities. An ACEE is constructed during user identification and
    verification. See ENVR object.

    ADAU.  See automatic direction of application updates.

    ADSP.  See automatic data set protection.

    ADSP attribute.  A user attribute that establishes an environment in
    which all permanent DASD data sets created by the user are
    automatically defined to RACF and protected with a discrete profile.
    See automatic data set protection.

    AIM.  See application identity mapping (AIM).

    application identity mapping (AIM).  Allows mapping between RACF
    user IDs and various application identities, such as those
    associated with z/OS UNIX, Novell Directory Services, and Lotus
    NotesÂ®.

    application user identity.  An alternate name by which a RACF user
    can be known to an application.

    appropriate privileges.  Describes which users can perform an action
    (such as execute a command, issue a syscall, and so forth) in a UNIX
    environment. Usually refers to having superuser authority or an
    appropriate subset of superuser authority.

    attribute.  See user attribute and group-related user attribute.

    AUDITOR attribute.  A user attribute that allows the user to specify
    logging options on the RACF commands and list any profile (including
    its auditing options) using the RACF commands. Contrast with
    group-AUDITOR attribute.

    authentication.  (1) Verification of the identity of a user or the
    user's eligibility to access an object.  (2) Verification that a
    message has not been altered or corrupted.  (3) A process used to
    verify the user of an information system or protected resources. See
    also password.

    authority.  The right to access objects, resources, or functions.
    See access authority, class authority, and group authority.

    automatic command direction.  An RRSF function that enables RACF to
    automatically direct certain commands to one or more remote nodes
    after running the commands on the issuing node. Commands can be
    automatically directed based on who issued the command, the command
    name, or the profile class related to the command. Profiles in the
    RRSFDATA class control to which nodes commands are automatically
    directed. See automatic direction of application updates, automatic
    password direction and command direction.

    automatic data set protection (ADSP).  A system function, enabled by
    the SETROPTS ADSP specification and the assignment of the ADSP
    attribute to a user with ADDUSER or ALTUSER, that causes all
    permanent data sets created by the user to be automatically defined
    to RACF with a discrete RACF profile.

    automatic direction.  See automatic command direction, automatic
    password direction, and automatic direction of application updates.

    automatic direction of application updates.  An RRSF function that
    automatically directs ICHEINTY and RACROUTE macros that update the
    RACF database to one or more remote systems. Profiles in the
    RRSFDATA class control which macros are automatically directed, and
    to which nodes. See automatic command direction and automatic
    password direction.

    automatic password direction.  An RRSF function that extends
    password synchronization and automatic command direction to cause
    RACF to automatically change the password for a user ID on one or
    more remote nodes after the password for that user ID is changed on
    the local node.  Profiles in the RRSFDATA class control for which
    users and nodes passwords are automatically directed. See password
    synchronization, automatic command direction, and automatic
    direction of application updates.

    automatic profile.  A tape volume profile that RACF creates when a
    RACF-defined user protects a tape data set. When the last data set
    on the volume is deleted, RACF automatically deletes the tape volume
    profile.  Contrast with nonautomatic profile.

=B
    backup data set.  A data set in the backup RACF database. For each
    data set in the primary RACF database, an installation should define
    a corresponding backup data set.  See backup RACF database.

    backup RACF database.  A RACF database that reflects the contents of
    the primary RACF database.  Backup RACF databases might be
    designated in the data set name table (ICHRDSNT) or specified at IPL
    time. You can switch to a backup database without a re-IPL if the
    primary RACF database fails. See primary RACF database.

    base ACL entry.  Same as permission bits (owner, group, other). The
    permissions can be changed using chmod. They are not physically part
    of the ACL.

    base segment.  The portion of a RACF profile that contains the
    fundamental information about a user, group, or resource. The base
    segment contains information that is common to all applications that
    use the profile.

    block update command (BLKUPD).  A RACF diagnostic command used to
    examine or modify the content of individual physical records in a
    RACF data set.

=C
    callable service.  In z/OS UNIX, a request by an active process for
    a service. Synonymous with syscall.

    category.  See security category.

    CDMF.  See Commercial Data Masking Facility.

    CDT.  See class descriptor table.

    certificate.  See digital certificate.

    certificate authority.  An organization that issues digital
    certificates.  The certificate authority authenticates the
    certificate owner's identity and the services that the owner is
    authorized to use, issues new certificates, renews existing
    certificates, and revokes certificates belonging to users who are no
    longer authorized to use them.

    certificate-authority certificate.  A type of certificate managed by
    RACF.  See digital certificate.

    certificate name filter.  A general resource profile created by the
    RACDCERT MAP command that maps multiple user IDs to a digital
    certificate in order to simplify administration of certificates,
    conserve storage space in the RACF database, maintain
    accountability, or maintain access control granularity.

    class.  A collection of RACF-defined entities (users, groups, and
    resources) with similar characteristics. Classes are defined in the
    class descriptor table (CDT), except for the USER, GROUP, and
    DATASET classes.

    class authority (CLAUTH).  An attribute enabling a user to define
    RACF profiles in a class defined in the class descriptor table. A
    user can have class authorities to zero or more classes.

    class descriptor table (CDT).  A table consisting of an entry for
    each class except the USER, GROUP, and DATASET classes. The CDT
    contains the classes supplied by IBM and the installation-defined
    classes. When this term appears without the preceding modifiers
    dynamic or static, it refers to the combination of the dynamic CDT,
    if it exists, and the static CDT.

    classification model 1.  See single-subsystem scope.

    classification model 2.  See multiple-subsystem scope.

    CLAUTH attribute.  See class authority.

    command direction.  An RRSF function that allows a user to issue a
    command from one user ID and direct that command to run in the RACF
    address space on the same system or on a different RRSF node, using
    the same or a different user ID. Before a command can be directed
    from one user ID to another, a user ID association must be defined
    between them using the RACLINK command.

    Commercial Data Masking Facility (CDMF).  An encryption function
    that uses a weaker key (40 bit) of the Data Encryption Standard
    (DES) algorithm.  RACF uses CDMF to mask the data portion of RRSF
    transaction processing message packets. CDMF is part of the IBM
    Common Cryptographic Architecture.

    conditional access list.  The portion of a resource profile that
    specifies the users and groups that might access the resource at a
    specified level when a specified condition is true. For example,
    with program access to data sets, the condition is that the user
    must be executing the program specified in the access list. Contrast
    with standard access list.

    coordinator system.  In a RACF data sharing group, the system on
    which the system operator or administrator enters a RACF command
    that is propagated throughout the group.  Contrast with peer system.

    CPF.  See command prefix facility.

    current connect group.  The group specified by a user when logging
    on to the system, or the user's default group if the user did not
    specify a group when logging on.  With SETROPTS NOGRPLIST in effect,
    RACF uses the user's authority and this group's authority during
    access checking. With SETR GRPLIST in effect, RACF includes the
    authority of the user's other groups, if any, but the user still has
    only one "current connect group".  You can use the &RACGPID variable
    in members of GLOBAL profiles to refer to the user's current connect
    group.

    current security label.  The security label that RACF uses in RACF
    authorization checking if the SECLABEL class is active. For
    interactive users, this is the security label specified when the
    user logged on, or (if no security label was specified) the default
    security label in the user's user profile. For batch jobs, this is
    the security label specified in the SECLABEL operand of the JOB
    statement, or (if no security label was specified) the user's
    current security label in the user profile associated with the job.

    custom field.  A field in a user or group profile that can be used
    to store installation data, and for which the installation can
    customize the keyword name and attributes. A custom field is defined
    in the CFDEF segment of a general resource profile in the CFIELD
    class. Installation data contained in a custom field is stored in
    the CSDATA segment of the user or group profile.

=D
    DASDVOL authority.  A preferred alternative to assigning the
    OPERATIONS or group-OPERATIONS attribute, DASDVOL authority allows
    you to authorize operations personnel to access only those volumes
    that they must maintain.  Using DASDVOL authority is also more
    efficient for functions such as volume dumping, because only one
    authorization check for the volume needs to be issued, instead of
    individual requests for each data set on the volume. Note that
    modern data management software (such as DFSMSdss) does not require
    DASDVOL authority. Contrast with OPERATIONS attribute, and
    group-OPERATIONS attribute.

    data security.  The protection of data from intentional or
    unintentional unauthorized disclosure, modification, or destruction.

    data security monitor (DSMON).  A RACF auditing tool that produces
    reports enabling an installation to verify its basic system
    integrity and data security controls.

    data set profile.  A profile that provides RACF protection for one
    or more data sets. The information in the profile can include the
    data set profile name, profile owner, universal access authority,
    access list, and other data. See discrete profile and generic
    profile.

    data sharing group, RACF.  A collection of one or more instances of
    RACF in a sysplex that have been identified to XCF and assigned to
    the group defined for RACF sysplex data sharing. RACF joins group
    IRRXCF00 when enabled for sysplex communication.

    data sharing mode.  An operational RACF mode that is available when
    RACF is enabled for sysplex communication. Data sharing mode
    requires installation of coupling facility hardware.

    default ACL.  An ACL that is specifically associated with a
    directory, and which gets inherited by an object created within the
    directory.

    default group.  The group specified in a user profile that provides
    a default current connect group for the user. See current connect
    group.

    delegated resource.  A general resource that is eligible to be
    accessed by specially programmed applications that request RACF to
    check the daemon or application's authority for a resource when the
    client's authority is insufficient.  Applications programmed in this
    way, such as the FTP daemon, are said to contain support for nested
    ACEEs because the identity of the daemon is said to be nested
    beneath the identity of the client for authorization purposes. See
    nested ACEE.

    delegation.  The act of giving users or groups the necessary
    authority to perform RACF operations.

    digital certificate.  A digital document that binds a public key to
    the identity of the certificate owner, thereby enabling the
    certificate owner to be authenticated.  A certificate is issued by a
    certificate authority.

    RACF can manage three types of digital certificates:

      o CERTIFICATE-AUTHORITY certificate. A certificate associated with
        a certificate authority and is used to verify signatures in
        other certificates.

      o SITE certificate. A certificate associated with A server, or
        network entity other than a user or certificate authority.

      o USER certificate. A certificate associated with A RACF user id
        that is used to authenticate the user's identity, and might also
        be used to represent a server.

    directed command.  A RACF command that is issued from a user ID on
    an RRSF node. It runs in the RACF subsystem address space on the
    same or a different RRSF node under the authority of the same or a
    different user ID. A directed command is one that specifies AT or
    ONLYAT. See command direction and automatic command direction.

    directory default ACL.  A model ACL that gets inherited by
    subdirectories that are created within the parent directory.

    directory model ACL.  See directory default ACL.

    discrete profile.  A resource profile that provides RACF protection
    for a single resource.  Contrast with generic profile and fully
    qualified generic profile.

    discretionary access control.  An access control environment in
    which the resource owner determines who can access the resource.
    Contrast with mandatory access control.

    disjoint.  Pertaining to security labels, when the set of security
    categories that defines the first does not include the set of
    security categories that defines the second, and the set of security
    categories that defines the second does not include the set of
    security categories that defines the first. This also means that the
    first does not dominate the second and the second does not dominate
    the first. See dominate.

    distributed identity filter.  A mapping association between a RACF
    user ID and one or more distributed user identities which is stored
    in a general resource profile in the IDIDMAP class and administered
    using the RACMAP command. A distributed identity filter consists of
    one or more components of a distributed user's name and the name of
    the registry where the user is defined.

    dominate.  One security label dominates a second security label when
    the security level that defines the first is equal to or greater
    than the security level that defines the second, and the set of
    security categories that defines the first includes the set of
    security categories that defines the second. A security label
    dominates itself since comparison of a security label with itself
    meets this definition.

    DSMON.  See data security monitor.

    dynamic CDT.  An optional portion of the class descriptor table that
    contains RACF classes built from profiles in the CDT general
    resource class. It does not include the required classes that
    comprise the supplied CDT (module ICHRRCDX) nor the optional classes
    that comprise the installation-defined CDT (module ICHRRCDE), if it
    exists. The dynamic CDT is processed as a logical extension of the
    static CDT. See also static CDT.

=E
    effective group identifier (effective GID).  When the user connects
    to the system (for example, logs on to a TSO/E session), one group
    is selected as the user's current group. When a user becomes a z/OS
    UNIX user, the GID of the user's current group becomes the effective
    GID of the user's process.  The user can access resources available
    to members of the user's effective GID. See group identifier (GID)
    and contrast with real GID.

    effective user identifier (effective UID).  When a user becomes a
    z/OS UNIX user, the UID from the user's RACF user profile becomes
    the effective UID of the user's process. The system uses the
    effective UID to determine if the user is a file owner. See user
    identifier (UID) and contrast with real UID.

    entity.  A user, group, or resource (for example, a DASD data set)
    that is defined to RACF.

    envelope.  A container stored in the user's profile that contains
    the user's encrypted password or password phrase so that it can be
    retrieved and decrypted by authorized users of the R_Admin callable
    service (IRRSEQ00) as part of a password synchronization solution,
    such as IBM Tivoli Directory Integrator.

    ENVR object.  A transportable form of the ACEE that can be used
    within a single system to create the original ACEE without accessing
    the RACF database. It can be used, with limits, elsewhere in a
    single sysplex to recreate the original ACEE without accessing the
    RACF database.

    equivalence.  Two security labels that contain the same security
    level and the same set of categories are considered equivalent, with
    each being dominated by and dominating the other.

    extended ACL entry.  An ACL entry for an individual user or group.

=F
    failsoft processing.  (1) Processing that occurs when no data sets
    in the primary RACF database are available (RACF is installed but
    inactive). RACF cannot make decisions to grant or deny access. The
    operator is prompted frequently to grant or deny access to data
    sets. The resource manager decides on the action for general
    resource classes with a return code of 4.  (2) Failsoft processing
    can also occur as the result of RVARY INACTIVE (temporary failsoft)
    or as the result of a serious system error requiring a re-IPL
    (permanent failsoft).

    field-level access checking.  The RACF facility by which a security
    administrator can control access to segments, other than the base
    segment, in a RACF profile and fields in those segments.

    file default ACL.  A model ACL that is inherited by files that are
    created within the parent directory.

    file model ACL.  See file default ACL.

    file permission bits.  In z/OS UNIX, information about a file that
    is used, along with other information, to determine if a process has
    read, write, or execute/search permission to a file or directory.
    The bits are divided into three parts, which are owner, group, and
    other.

    file security packet (FSP).  In z/OS UNIX, a control block
    containing the security data (file's owner user identifier (UID),
    owner group identifier (GID), and the permission bits) associated
    with the file. This data is stored with the file in the file system.

    file system object.  Used to generically refer to either a file or
    directory.

    FSP.  See file security packet.

    fully qualified generic profile.  A DATASET profile that was defined
    using the GENERIC operand and has a name that contains no generic
    characters. A fully qualified generic profile protects only
    resources whose names exactly match the name of the profile.
    Contrast with discrete profile and generic profile.

=G
    general resource.  Any resource, other than an MVS data set, that is
    defined in the class descriptor table (CDT). General resources
    include DASD volumes, tape volumes, load modules, terminals, IMS and
    CICS transactions, and installation-defined resource classes.

    general resource profile.  A profile that provides RACF protection
    for one or more general resources.  The information in the profile
    can include the general resource profile name, profile owner,
    universal access authority, access list, and other data.

    general user.  A user who has limited RACF privileges, such as
    logging on, accessing resources, and creating data sets. General
    users typically use and create RACF-protected resources, but have no
    authority to administer resources other than their own.

    generic profile.  A resource profile that can provide RACF
    protection for zero or more resources. The resources protected by a
    generic profile have similar names and identical security
    requirements, though with RACFVARS, a generic profile can protect
    resources with dissimilar names, too. For example, a generic data
    set profile can protect one or more data sets.  Contrast with
    discrete profile.

    global access checking.  The ability to allow an installation to
    establish an in-storage table of default values for authorization
    levels for selected resources. RACF refers to this table before
    performing normal RACROUTE REQUEST=AUTH processing and grants the
    request without performing an AUTH request if the requested access
    authority does not exceed the global value. RACF uses this table to
    process AUTH requests faster and with less overhead (no checking of
    access lists, no auditing) when you have resources for which you
    decide to grant access to all users, except those with restricted
    user IDs. If the requested access does not exceed the access granted
    by the table, RACF bypasses most of its normal AUTH processing.
    Global access checking can grant the user access to the resource,
    but it cannot deny access.

    globally RACLISTed profiles.  In-storage profiles for RACF-defined
    resources that are created by RACROUTE REQUEST=LIST and that are
    anchored from an ACEE. Globally RACLISTed in-storage profiles are
    shared across a system, such as the way that in-storage profiles
    created by SETROPTS RACLIST are shared. Contrast with locally
    RACLISTed profiles.

    group.  A collection of RACF-defined users who can share access
    authorities for protected resources.

    group-ADSP attribute.  A group-related user attribute similar to the
    ADSP attribute for a user, but assigned by using the CONNECT command
    to restrict its effect to those cases where the user creates data
    sets with that group as the high level qualifier of the data set
    name (or as determined by the naming convention table or exit).

    group-AUDITOR attribute.  A group-related user attribute similar to
    the AUDITOR attribute for a user, but assigned by using the CONNECT
    command to restrict the user's authority to resources that are
    within the scope of the group. Contrast with AUDITOR attribute.

    group authority.  An authority specifying which functions a user can
    perform in a group. The group authorities are USE, CREATE, CONNECT,
    and JOIN.

    group data set.  A RACF-protected data set in which either the
    high-level qualifier of the data set name or the qualifier supplied
    by an installation-naming convention table or exit routine is a RACF
    group name.

    group-GRPACC attribute.  A group-related user attribute similar to
    the GRPACC attribute for a user, but assigned by using the CONNECT
    command to restrict its effect to the specific group. Contrast with
    GRPACC attribute.

    group ID.  Obsolete term for group name.

    group identifier (GID).  A number between 0 and 2147483647 that
    identifies a group of users to z/OS UNIX. The GID is associated with
    a RACF group name when it is specified in the OMVS segment of the
    group profile. See real GID. Contrast with effective group
    identifier (effective GID).

    group name.  A string of 1 - 8 characters that identifies a group to
    RACF.  The first character must be A - Z, # (X'7B'), $ (X'5B'), or @
    (X'7C'). The rest can be A - Z, #, $, @, or 0 - 9.

    group-OPERATIONS attribute.  (1) A group-related user attribute
    similar to the OPERATIONS attribute for a user, but assigned by
    using the CONNECT command to restrict its effect to those resources
    that are within the scope of the group.  (2) If a person needs to
    perform maintenance activities on DASD volumes, it is more efficient
    (for RACF processing) and better (for limiting the resources the
    person can access) to give the person authority to those volumes
    using the PERMIT command than to assign the person the OPERATIONS or
    group-OPERATIONS attribute. Contrast with DASDVOL authority and
    OPERATIONS attribute.

    group profile.  A profile that defines a group. The information in
    the profile includes the group name, profile owner, and users in the
    group.

    grouping profile.  A profile in a resource group class.

    group-related user attribute.  A user attribute, assigned at the
    group level, that enables the user to control the resource, group,
    and user profiles associated with the group and its subgroups.
    Group-related user attributes include group-SPECIAL attribute,
    group-AUDITOR attribute, and group-OPERATIONS attribute. Contrast
    with user attribute.

    group-REVOKE attribute.  Assigned through the CONNECT command that
    prevents the user from using that group as the current connect
    group. Also prevents RACF from considering that group during
    authorization checking.

    group-SPECIAL attribute.  A group-related user attribute similar to
    the SPECIAL user attribute, but it is assigned by the CONNECT
    command to restrict the user's authority to users, groups, and
    resources within the scope of the group. Within this scope, it gives
    the user full control over everything except auditing options.
    However, it does not give the user authority to change global RACF
    options that will affect processing outside the group's scope.
    Contrast with SPECIAL attribute.

    GRPACC attribute.  With this attribute, any group data sets that the
    user defines to RACF (through the ADSP attribute, the PROTECT
    operand on the DD statement, or the ADDSD command) are automatically
    made accessible to other users in the group at the UPDATE level of
    access authority if the user defining the profile is a member of the
    group. Contrast with group-GRPACC attribute.

=I
    ICB.  See inventory control block.

    ICL.  See issued certificate list (ICL).

    ICHRIN03.  See started procedures table.

    inheritance.  The act of automatically associating an ACL with a
    newly created object without requiring administrative action.

    issued certificate list (ICL).  PKI Services database containing the
    history of issued certificates.

    interprocess communication facilities (IPC).  IPC facilities are
    services that allow different processes to communicate.  Message
    passing (using message queues), semaphore sets, and shared memory
    services are forms of interprocess communication facilities.

    inventory control block (ICB).  The first block in a RACF database.
    The ICB contains a general description of the database and, for the
    master primary data set, holds the RACF global options specified by
    SETROPTS.

    installation-defined CDT.  An optional portion of the CDT (module
    ICHRRCDE) that is installed by the installation. The function
    provided by this module can be replaced with the dynamic CDT
    function.

    issuer's distinguished name (IDN).  The X.509 name that is
    associated with a certificate authority.

=K

    list-of-groups checking.  A RACF option (SETROPTS GRPLIST) that
    enables a user to access all resources available to all groups of
    which the user is a nonrevoked member, regardless of the user's
    current connect group. For any particular resource, RACF allows
    access based on the highest access among the groups in which the
    user is a member.

    RRSF logical node connection with any other RRSF node.

    locally RACLISTed profiles.  In-storage profiles for RACF-defined
    resources that are created by RACROUTE REQUEST=LIST and that are
    anchored from an ACEE. Locally RACLISTed in-storage profiles are not
    shared across a system, the way that in-storage profiles created by
    SETROPTS RACLIST are shared. Contrast with globally RACLISTed
    profiles.

    logging.  The recording of audit data about specific events.

    logical connection.  See RRSF logical node connection.

    designated to receive most of the RRSF communications sent to the
    node.

    managed user ID association.  A user ID association in which one of
    the associated user IDs is a managing user ID, and the other is a
    managed user ID. The managing user ID can run allowed RACF commands
    under the authority of the managed user ID. The managed user ID
    cannot run commands under the authority of the managing user ID. A
    managed user ID association does not allow password synchronization
    between the associated user IDs. Contrast with peer user ID
    association.

    mandatory access control (MAC).  A means of restricting access to
    objects on the basis of the sensitivity (as represented by a label)
    of the information contained in the objects and the formal
    authorization (clearance) of subjects to access information of such
    sensitivity.

    mask.  A technique to provide protection against casual viewing of a
    password that has been defined or altered, when an encryption
    function is not available.

    security levels (for example: unclassified, secret, top secret)
    combined with a system of non-hierarchical security categories (for
    example: Project A, Project B, Project C). The system imposes
    mandatory access controls restricting which users can access data
    based on a comparison of the classification of the users and the
    data.

    multiple console support (MCS).  The operator interface in an MVS
    system.

    multiple-subsystem scope.  A RACF classification model used in
    conjunction with the DB2 access control module, or RACF external
    security module, to construct DB2 resource names with the subsystem
    ID as part of the class name. Contrast with single-subsystem scope.

    multisystem node.  See multisystem RRSF node.

    multisystem RRSF node.  An RRSF node consisting of multiple MVS
    system images that share the same RACF database. One of the systems
    is designated to be the main system, and it receives the unsolicited

    object) of a daemon nested beneath the security environment of the
    client to support daemon access to delegated resources. See ACEE and
    delegated resource.

    node.  See RRSF node.

    nonautomatic profile.  A tape volume profile that RACF creates when
    an RDEFINE command is issued or when tape data set protection is not
    active.  A tape volume profile created in this manner is called a
    nonautomatic profile because RACF never deletes the profile except
    in response to the RDELETE command. Contrast with automatic profile.

    non-data sharing mode.  One of two normal modes of operation when
    RACF is enabled for sysplex communication and is the mode in which
    RACF communicates information using sysplex facilities to other
    instances of RACF, but does not make use of the coupling facility in
    doing so.

=O
    OPERATIONS attribute.  A user attribute that grants the equivalent
    of ALTER access to all data sets unless the user or one of the
    user's connect groups appears explicitly in the access list of a
    data set's profile. If a user needs to perform maintenance
    activities on DASD volumes, granting DASDVOL authority to those
    volumes using the PERMIT command is preferred over assigning the
    OPERATIONS or group-OPERATIONS attribute. Note that most modern DASD
    maintenance programs do not require the OPERATIONS attribute.
    Contrast with DASDVOL authority and group-OPERATIONS attribute.

    operator identification card (OIDCARD).  A small card with a
    magnetic stripe encoded with unique characters and used to verify
    the identity of a terminal operator to RACF.

    owner.  The user or group that creates a profile, or is specified as
    the owner of a profile. The owner can modify, list, or delete the
    profile.

=P
    PADS.  See program access to data sets (PADS).

    workstations and client machines to communicate with the host. It
    allows a user to gain access to the host system without sending the
    RACF password across the network.

    password.  A string of characters known to a user who must specify
    it to gain full or limited access to a system and to the data stored
    within it.  RACF uses a password to verify the identity of the user.

    password envelope.  See envelope.

    password synchronization.  An option that can be specified when a
    peer user ID association is defined between two user IDs. If
    password synchronization is specified for a user ID association,
    then whenever the password for one of the associated user IDs is
    changed, the password for the other user ID is automatically changed
    to the newly defined password.  See automatic password direction.

    password phrase.  A longer string of mixed characters known to a
    user who must specify it to gain full or limited access to a system
    and to the data stored within it. RACF uses a password phrase to
    verify the identity of the user. Used as a more secure alternative
    to the password.

    password phrase envelope.  See envelope.

    peer system.  In a RACF data sharing group, any system to which RACF
    propagates a command entered by the system operator or
    administrator.  Contrast with coordinator system.

    peer user ID association.  A user ID association that allows either
    user ID to run allowed RACF commands under the authority of the
    other user ID using command direction. A peer user ID association
    can also establish password synchronization between the associated
    user IDs. Contrast with managed user ID association.

    permission bits.  In z/OS UNIX, part of security controls for
    directories and files stored in the z/OS UNIX file system. Used to
    grant read, write, search (just directories), or execute (just
    files) access to owner, file or directory owning group, or all
    others.

    to its owner.  Contrast with public key.

    process.  In z/OS UNIX, a function created by a fork() request. See
    task.

    profile.  Data that describes the significant characteristics of a
    user, a group of users, or one or more computer resources. A profile
    contains a base segment, and optionally, a number of other segments.

    generic profile, group profile, and user profile.

    profile list.  A list of profiles indexed by class (for general
    resources) or by the high-level qualifier (for data set profiles)
    and built in storage by the RACF routines.

    profile modeling.  The ability for a user or an installation to copy
    information (such as universal access authority or access lists)
    from an existing resource profile when defining a new resource
    profile. This might occur automatically when using ADDSD based on
    the MODEL specification in a USER or group PROFILE, or manually with
    the FROM keyword of the ADDSD and RDEFINE commands, or with keywords
    on RACROUTE REQUEST=DEFINE.

    program access to data sets (PADS).  A RACF function that enables an
    authorized user or group of users to access one or more data sets at
    a specified access authority only while running a specified
    RACF-controlled program. See program control.

    control who can run RACF-controlled programs. See program access to
    data sets.

    protected resource.  A resource defined to RACF for the purpose of
    controlling access to the resource. Some of the resources that can
    be protected by RACF are DASD volumes, tape volumes, load modules,
    terminals, IMS and CICS transactions, and installation-defined
    resource classes.

    protected user ID.  A user ID that cannot enter the system by any
    means that requires a password or password phrase, and cannot be
    revoked by incorrect password and password phrase attempts.
    Assigning a protected user ID to z/OS UNIX, a UNIX daemon, or
    another important started task or subsystem assures that the ID
    cannot be used for other purposes, and that functions will not fail
    because the ID has been revoked.

    public key.  In public key cryptography, a key that is made
    available to everyone.  Contrast with private key.

    public key cryptography.  Cryptography in which public keys and
    private keys are used for encryption and decryption. One party uses
    a common public key and the other party uses secret private key. The
    keys are complementary in that if one is used to encrypt data, the
    other can be used to decrypt it.

    developed by RSA Corporation to facilitate interoperability for
    cryptographic protocols.

    public key infrastructure (PKI).  The set of hardware, software,
    people, policies, and procedures needed to create, manage, store,
    distribute, and revoke public key certificates based on public key

    RACF-indicated.  Pertaining to a data set for which the RACF
    indicator is set on. If a data set is RACF-indicated, a user can
    access the data set only if a RACF profile or an entry in the global
    access checking table exists for that data set. On a system without
    RACF, a user cannot access a RACF-indicated data set until the
    indicator is turned off. For VSAM data sets, the indicator is in the
    catalog entry. For non-VSAM data sets, the indicator is in the data
    set control block (DSCB). For data sets on tape, the indicator is in
    the RACF tape volume profile of the volume that contains the data
    set.

    to user IDs and group names in the RACF database. The utility can be
    used to find references to residual user IDs and group names or
    specified user IDs and group names. The output from this utility is
    a set of RACF commands that can be used to remove the references
    from the RACF database after review and possible modification. See
    residual user ID.

    RACF report writer.  A RACF function that produces reports on system
    use and resource use from information found in the RACF SMF records.

    RACF SMF data unload utility (IRRADU00).  A RACF utility that
    enables installations to create a sequential file from the
    security-relevant audit data. The sequential file can be viewed
    directly, used as input for installation-written programs, and
    manipulated with sort/merge utilities.  It can also be uploaded to a
    database manager (such as DB2) to process complex inquiries and
    create installation-tailored reports.  See SMF records.

    RACF storage manager.  Manages the allocation of storage for the
    RACF programs running on a system.

    TOKENBLD request, TOKENMAP request, TOKENXTR request, VERIFY
    request, and VERIFYX request.

    read-only mode.  A recovery mode of operation when RACF is enabled
    for sysplex communication. Read-only mode does not allow updates to
    be made to the RACF database except for statistics generated during
    logon and job initiation.

    real GID.  The attribute of a process that, at the time of process
    creation, identifies the group of the user who created the process.
    See group identifier (GID). Contrast with effective group identifier
    (effective GID).

    real UID.  The attribute of a process that, at the time of process
    creation, identifies the user who created the process. See user
    identifier (UID). Contrast with effective user identifier (effective

    has been deleted.

    Resource Access Control Facility (RACF).  A component of z/OS
    Security Server that provides access control by identifying and
    verifying the users to the system, authorizing access to protected
    resources, logging detected unauthorized attempts to enter the
    system, logging unauthorized attempts to enter the system, and
    logging detected accesses to protected resources.  RACF for z/VM is
    available as a feature of z/VM.

    resource group profile.  A general resource profile in a resource
    grouping class. A resource group profile can provide RACF protection
    for one or more resources with unlike names. See resource grouping
    class.

    resource grouping class.  A RACF class in which resource group
    profiles can be defined. A resource grouping class is related to
    another class, sometimes called a member class. For example, the
    resource grouping class GTERMINL is related to the class TERMINAL.
    See resource group profile.

    resource profile.  A profile that provides RACF protection for one
    or more resources. USER, GROUP, and CONNECT profiles are not
    resource profiles.  The information in a resource profile can
    include the profile name, profile owner, universal access authority,
    access list, and other data.  Resource profiles can be discrete
    profiles or generic profiles. See discrete profile and generic
    profile.

    RESTRICTED attribute.  A user attribute that can be assigned to a
    shared user ID, such as PUBLIC or ANONYMOS, or a user ID used with a
    certificate name filter, to prevent the user ID from being used to
    access protected resources it is not specifically authorized to
    access. Restricted users cannot gain access to protected resources
    through global access checking, UACC, or an ID(*) entry on the
    access list, and optionally, to a z/OS UNIX file system object
    through the 'other' bits.

    reverse mandatory access check.  A mandatory access check in which
    the security label of the resource must dominate the security label
    of the user in order for the user to be granted access to the
    resource.

    TARGET command. See RRSF logical node connection.

    RTOKEN.  The RACF resource security token. An RTOKEN is an
    encapsulation or representation of the security characteristics of a
    resource. Resource managers, for example JES, can assign RTOKENs to
    the resources they manage; for example, JES spool files. See UTOKEN
    and STOKEN.

    information used to control access to data.

    security classification.  The use of security categories, a security
    level, or both, to impose additional access controls on sensitive
    resources. An alternative way to provide security classifications is
    to use security labels.

    security label.  An installation-defined name that corresponds to a
    specific RACF security level with a set of zero or more security
    categories. This is equivalent to the NCSC term sensitivity label.

    security level.  An installation-defined name that corresponds to a
    numerical security level; the higher the number, the higher the

    maintaining system security.  (2) Variable-length process or status
    records from the SMF data set that are written to the SMF log data
    set. These records vary in layout based on the type of system
    information they contain. See RACF SMF data unload utility.

    source user ID.  The source half of a source user ID and target user
    ID pair that has an established user ID association between them.
    For command direction the source user ID is the user ID that issued
    the command that is being directed. For password synchronization the
    source user ID is the user ID whose password changed, causing a
    change to the password of the target user ID. Contrast with target
    user ID.

    SPECIAL attribute.  A user attribute that gives the user full
    control over all of the RACF profiles in the RACF database and
    allows the user to issue all RACF commands, except for commands and

    that enables programs to use system authorization services in order
    to control access to resources, such as data sets and MVS commands.
    SAF either processes security authorization requests directly or
    works with RACF, or other security product, to process them.

    system call.  In z/OS UNIX, a synonym for callable service.

    multivolume data set resides. A volume set is represented in one
    RACF profile.

    tape volume table of contents (TVTOC).  Information about a tape
    data set that RACF stores in the tape volume profile for the volume
    on which the data set resides. The TVTOC includes the data set name,
    data set sequence number, creation date, and an indicator as to
    whether a discrete tape data set profile exists.

    target node.  An RRSF node that a given RRSF node is logically
    connected to, as a result of a TARGET command. See local node and
    remote node.

    target user ID.  The target half of a source user ID and target user
    ID pair that has an established user ID association between them.
    For command direction, the target user ID is the user ID specified
    on the AT or ONLYAT keyword, and is the user ID under whose
    authority the command is run on the specified node.  For password
    synchronization, the target user ID is the user ID whose password
    RACF automatically updates when the password for the source user ID
    is changed. Contrast with source user ID.

    UADS.  See user attribute data set.

    universal access authority (UACC).  The default access authority
    that applies to a resource if the user or group is not specifically
    permitted access to the resource, unless the user is restricted. The
    universal access authority can be any of the access authorities.

    universal group.  A user group defined using the UNIVERSAL operand
    of the ADDGROUP command.  Universal groups are expected to have a
    large number of members and are unlikely to be deleted. Group
    profiles for universal groups do not contain complete membership
    information, and the LISTGRP command is not recommended to list
    members. Using the output of the database unload utility (IRRDBU00)
    is the best way to list members of a universal group.

    user.  A person who requires the services of a computing system.

    user attribute.  The extraordinary privileges, restrictions, and
    processing environments assigned to a user. The user attributes are
    SPECIAL, AUDITOR, CLAUTH, OPERATIONS, GRPACC, ADSP, and REVOKE.

    high-level qualifier of the data set name or the qualifier supplied
    by an installation exit routine is a RACF user ID.

    user ID.  A RACF user ID. A string of 1 - 8 alphanumeric characters
    that uniquely identifies a RACF user, procedure, or batch job to the
    system.  For TSO users, the user ID cannot exceed 7 characters and
    must begin with an alphabetic, #, $, or @ character. The user ID is
    defined by a user profile in the RACF database and is used as the
    name of the profile.

    user ID association.  A relationship between two user IDs,
    established through the RACLINK command, which is required for
    command direction and password synchronization between the user IDs.
    See peer user ID association and managed user ID association.

    user identification.  See user ID.

    user identification and verification.  The acts of identifying and
    verifying a RACF-defined user to the system during logon or batch
    job processing. RACF identifies the user by the user ID and verifies
    the user by the password, password phrase, PassTicket, verified
    digital certificate, or operator identification card supplied during
    logon processing or the password supplied on a batch JOB statement.

    user identifier (UID).  A number between 0 and 2147483647 that
    identifies a user to z/OS UNIX. The UID is associated with a RACF
    user ID when it is specified in the OMVS segment of the user
    profile. It can be contained in an object of type uid_t, that is
    used to identify a system user. When the identity of the user is
    associated with a process, a UID value is referred to as a real UID,
    an effective UID, or an (optional) saved set UID. See real UID.
    Contrast with effective user identifier (effective UID).

    user name.  In RACF, 1 - 20 alphanumeric characters that represent a
    RACF-defined user. Contrast with user ID.

    user profile.  A description of a RACF-defined user that includes
    the user ID, user name, default group name, password, password
    phrase, profile owner, user attributes, and other information. A
    user profile can include information for subsystems such as TSO and
    DFP.

    UTOKEN.  The RACF user security token. A UTOKEN is an encapsulation
    or representation of the security characteristics of a user. RACF
    assigns a UTOKEN to each user in the system. See STOKEN and RTOKEN.

=V
    verification.  See user identification and verification.

    virtual key ring.  The set of certificates owned by a user ID and
    used by a user or server application to determine the
    trustworthiness of a client or peer entity. Each RACF user ID is
    associated with a virtual key ring.  In contrast to a real key ring,
    a virtual key ring is not added to RACF.  In addition, the private
    key cannot be retrieved from a CERTAUTH or SITE virtual key ring, as
    it can be from a real key ring. The most common type is the CERTAUTH
    virtual key ring which is used when an application uses a key ring
    to validate the certificates of others but has no need for its own
    certificate and private key.

=W
    workspace data sets.  VSAM data sets used by RACF for queuing
    requests sent to and received from target nodes in an RRSF
    environment.

    writedown mode.  The setting of an address space at which it can
    create output data at a lower security label than the current
    security label of the address space on a system where writedown is
    normally disallowed because the RACF MLS(FAILURES) option is in
    effect.

    writedown privilege.  The ability of users to set their address
    spaces to writedown mode in which they are able to write data to an
    object with a lower security label than the user's current security
    label on a system where writedown is normally disallowed because the
    RACF MLS(FAILURES) option is in effect.

=Z
    z/OS UNIX group identifier (GID).  See group identifier (GID).

    z/OS UNIX System Services (z/OS UNIX).  The set of functions
    provided by the shells, utilities, kernel, file system, debugger,
    Language Environment, and other elements of the z/OS operating
    system that allows users to write and run application programs that
    conform to UNIX standards.

    z/OS UNIX user identifier (UID).  See user identifier (UID).

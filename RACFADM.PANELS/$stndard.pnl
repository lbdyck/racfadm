*                        RACFADM - Standards                          *
*---------------------------------------------------------------------*

  The following standards have been put in place, in hopes of making
  RACFADM easier to use and maintain:

  1) Panels
     - Member names
         $$DIR ...... Directory of all members and description
         $DEFSETG ... Define site wide defaults for new users and
                      if need be, force a refresh of certain variables
                      for existing users (SETR??? = Y)
         $DEFSITE ... Define site wide defaults overrides for new users
                      * This member is optional, but if it exists, it
                        will be read and override any settings defined
                        in member $DEFSETG
                      * This will prevent from having to update the
                        $DEFSETG member every time a new version of
                        RACFADM is installed
         $??????? ... Data/informational ($CHANGES, $ISSUES, etc.)
         #??????? ... Tutorials
         RACF???? ... Menu, data entry and table panels
       Where ? can be any characters
     - Code
       -- At the bottom of the panel are comments documenting
          items of interest
       -- All panels allow invocation of a tutorial panel
     - Main menu
       -- Numbered entries (1-99) are designated for obtaining,
          displaying/changing the RACF database (Userids,
          Groups, etc.) and customizing the utility (Settings)
       -- Alphabetic entries (A-Z) are used to assist in maintaining
          or documenting RACFADM
       -- The RACFMENU panel is a primary option menu so one can use
          the jump function (=?) to go directly to any RACFMENU option
          * For example, if one is accessing User (option 1) to
            display userids, and would like to jump directly to
            Dataset (Option 3) without having to press F3 (END),
            just type in =3 on the primary command line
       -- All entries are point-n-shoot fields
     - Tables
       -- Panels displaying tables
          * Primary commands FIND, SORT, LOCATE, ONLY and RESET are
            available and operate in the same manner
            o When possible the RESET command will allow changing
              the filter criteria, by passing it a text string as
              a parameter
          * The SORTed column is the color turquois and un-sorted
            columns are green
          * The LOCATE command operates on the SORTed column
          * Column headers are point-n-shoot sort fields
            o Can place cursor on column header and press ENTER
            o It will sort the column ascending order the 1st time,
              and if accomplished again, will sort the column in
              descending order (some fields may be reversed, due the
              column is already sorted in ascending order)

  2) REXX
     - Member names
         $$DIR ...... Directory of all members and description
         RACF???? ... REXX programs, where ???? can be characters
     - Code
       -- A comment box is coded at the top of each REXX program,
          the purpose of the code and changes made:
              /*------------------------------------------------------*
              /* FLG  YYMMDD  USERID   DESCRIPTION                    *
              /* ---  ------  -------  -------------------------------*
              /* @A1  200615  RACFA    Fixed date/time                *
              /* @A0  200605  RACFA    Created skeleton               *
              /*======================================================*
       -- Changes are documented by commenting/using a flag character
          * '/* @?? */' in columns 62-71
            o Where ??, 1st character is A-Z, and 2nd character is
              is 1-9, then A-Z
            o Also, the flag character is documented in the comment
              box at the top of the program, most current at the top
          * Example:
              parse source . . REXXPGM .                     /* @A1 */
              REXXPGM  = LEFT(REXXPGM,8)                     /* @A1 */
       -- A comment box is coded above each subroutine, documenting
          the purpose of the code
       -- All REXX programs allow:
          * Viewing and logging the RACF commands and the return code,
            by changing the Settings (Option 0) 'RACF commands' field
          * Tracing the REXX program, by changing the Settings
            (Option 0) 'REXX trace' field
          * The capability to have the user control how they want
            to display any files/reports by changing the Settings
            (Option 0) 'Display files' field to Browse, Edit or View

  3) Skeletons
     - Member names
         $$DIR ...... Directory of all members and description
         RACF???? ... Skeleton, where ???? can be any characters
     - Code
       -- A comment box is coded at the top of each skeleton,
          documenting the purpose of the code and changes made:
              /*------------------------------------------------------*
              /* FLG  YYMMDD  USERID   DESCRIPTION                    *
              /* ---  ------  -------  -------------------------------*
              /* @A1  200615  RACFA    Fixed date/time                *
              /* @A0  200605  RACFA    Created skeleton               *
              /*======================================================*

  3) Settings
     - The following are the naming standard for variables used to
       save the user's Settings (Option 0)
       -- Syntax
            SET#????
       -- Where
            SET .... Settings (Option 0)
            # ...... G=General, M=Management, T=Adding TSO Userid,
                     P=Program/Panel (Load, REXX or CLIST member),
                     D=Dataset, J=JCL and R=Refresh
            ???? ... Field name, any characters and for Refresh
                     variables (4th chr = R) the section name
                     (GEN, MGT, TSO, MVS, IBM, RPT and MSG)
       -- The REXX programs and panels will translate the abbreviated
          contents to its full word, in hopes of making it easier to
          understand/maintain the code, for example: Y, will be
          translated to YES

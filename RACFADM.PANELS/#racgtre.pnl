+  The%Data Security Monitor (DSMON)+produces a set of reports that
+  provide information about the current status of the data security
+  environment.
+
+  The!Group Tree Report+lists, for each requested group, all of its
+  subgroups, all of the subgroups' subgroups, and so on, as well as
+  the owner of each group listed in the report, if the owner is not
+  the superior group.
+
+  And it can be used to examine the overall RACF group structure
+  and determine the scope of the group for group-related user
+  attributes (group-SPECIAL, group-OPERATIONS and group-AUDITOR).

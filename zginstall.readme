ZIGI Managed Repository Generalized Installation Tool

The zginstall.rex is the ZIGI generalized installation tool and it is
used by this repository, when the ZIGI ISPF dialog is not used, to
install the repositories z/OS datasets from the Git OMVS repository.

Note: that if the repository was downloaded from GitHub as a zip file
rather than doing a git clone operation that the file attributes may not
be accurate. These are resolved by the zginstall.rex which will detect
this and call the zgcvtenc.awk routine to resolve the file attributes by
changing them from iso8859-1 to ibm1047 prior to creating the z/OS
datasets.

To use zginstall.rex:

    1. Enter OMVS via TSO OMVS or via ssh
    2. At the shell prompt change to the directory where the Git
       repository is located
    3. Enter at the shell prompt ./zginstall.rex
    4. Enter when prompted the z/OS dataset high level qualifier to be
       used for the z/OS datasets to be created from this Git repository
    5. When zginstall.rex completes all of the z/OS datasets that are
       part of the Git repository will have been copied into newly
       allocated z/OS datasets.
    6. Next return to TSO/ISPF and execute the ZGSTAT command that is
       documented by the zginstall.rex installation report. This will
       apply the ISPF statistics to all of the partitioned datasets,
       something that ZIGI supports because neither Git or shell
       understand what ISPF statistics are.
